    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "These are eggs from hens who are kept in a small cage. Some may call this \"unethical eggs\".\n",
    "The study revealed that NB provided a high accuracy of 90% when classifying between the 2 groups of eggs.--\n",
    "Strengths--\n",
    "Converges quicker than discriminative models like Logistic Regression hence less data is required.--\n",
    "Weaknesses--\n",
    "Requires observations to be independent of one another.\n",
    "But in practice, the classifier performs quite well even when the independence assumption is violated\n",
    "Simple representation without opportunities for hyperparameter tuning.--\n",
    "Suitability for the problem--\n",
    "This algorithm performs well for this problem because the data has the following properties:\n",
    "Low number of observations.\n",
    "Naive bayes performs well on small datasets.\n",
    "2. Logistic Regression--\n",
    "Industry usage (Penderson et. al 2014):\n",
    "Classification of protein sequences--\n",
    "Identify and automatically categorize protein sequences into one of 11 pre-defined classes.\n",
    "Tremendous potential for further bioinformatics applications using Logistic Regression.--\n",
    "Strengths--\n",
    "Many ways to regularize the model to tolerate some errors and avoid over-fitting.\n",
    "Unlike Naive Bayes, we do not have to worry about correlated features.\n",
    "Unlike Support Vector Machines, we can easily take in new data using an online gradient descent method.--\n",

    "Requires observations to be independent of one another.\n",
    "It aims to predict based on independent variables, if there are not properly identified, Logistic Regression provides little predictive value.--\n",
    "Suitability for the problem--\n",
    "Many features may be correlated.\n",
    "And Logistic Regression, unlike Naive Bayes, can deal with this problem.\n",
    "Regularization to prevent overfitting due to dataset having many features.\n",
    "3. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)--\n",
    "Industry usage (Di Pillo et. al 2016):\n",
    "Sales forecasting when running promotions--\n",
    "Originally, statistical methods like ARIMA and smoothing methods are used like Exponential Smoothing.\n",
    "But they could fail if high irregularity of sales are present.\n",
    "Hence SVMs provide a good alternative.--\n",
    "Strengths--\n",
    "SVM have regularization parameters to tolerate some errors and avoid over-fitting.\n",
    "Kernel trick: Users can build in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernel.\n",
    "Provides a good out-of-sample generalization, if the parameters C and gamma are appropriate chosen.\n",
    "In other words, SVM might be more robust even when the training sample has some bias.--\n",
    "Weaknesses--\n",
    "Bad interpretability: SVMs are black boxes.\n",
    "High computational cost: SVMs scale exponentially in training time.\n",
    "Users might need to have certain domain knowledge to use kernel function.--\n",
    "Suitability for the problem--\n",

So, I don't consider the Gaussian NB is the best model.\n",
    "Second, compare Logistic Regression and SVM, both these models have nice accuracy score and f-score, and the scores of these two models are quite the same. Furthermore, the scores on training subset and testing set of these two models are quite the same as well which means both these two model are suitable for the data. However, we can see that the predicting/training time of SVM are much longer than those of logistic regression. So, I will choose the logistic regression as my best model.**"

    "**Answer: \n",
    "1. I’ll give an example to explain the logistic regression in a layman’s term.\n",
    "2. Suppose you have data from past years about students in your class: say math scores and science scores of their final board exams which are features. Also, when they come back for school re-union 5 years later, you collected data on whether they were successful or not in life which is the label. \n",
    "3. During the training phase:\n",
    "You have scores, you also know whether a person succeeds or not. You then put all these variable (both features and label) into the model and the model start to learn which “kind” of students would be success 5 years from now. That is, the model start to put students into a scatter plot graph and label them 1 (successful) or 0 (not successful), then learn to produce a line to separate these students into 2 groups. \n",
    "4. And in the predictive phase:\n",
    "Now, suppose you know that Sarah scored 94 in science, 82 in math, and now you want to predict how successful she will be in 5 years. Though you don’t have the data about whether Sarah would be successful or not, you have a model that learned from previous batches of data. You could then plug in Sarah's scores into the model (put the data into the same scatter plot graph), and the model spits out a number between 0 and 1. Then you could predict whether Sarah will be successful or not by seeing which side Sarah is on. That is, by looking at this, if it is greater than 0.5 you say you predict person is successful. If it is less than 0.5 you'll say they might not be successful.\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",

    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "**Answer: Both the accuracy score and f-score of my unoptimized model and optimized model are much higher than those of the benchmark predictor, since always predicting an individual to make more than $50000 seems to be a naive prediction. However, both the accuracy score and f-score of my optimized model (accuracy:0.8293, f-score:0.6548) are a little bit lower than those of my unoptimized model (accuracy:0.8296,f-score:0.6556). I found that when parameter C in my model (logistic regression) equals to 1 (which I set in my default model), the result got optimum accuracy score and F-score. And after I tuned this parameter without value=1, the result got a little bit worse even if smaller value of this parameter usually specify stronger regularization. **"

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

The reason I rank occupation as first is because I believe that the higher status of occupation, the more money they earn. The reason I rank education level as second is because I think that higher education level help people get higher status of occupation which, as I say above, lets them earn more money. The reason I rank marital-status as third is that people who have earned more (or enough) money have more willingness to get married. The forth is age, because I think the older, the more work experience they have, and thus, more money they earn. Finally, I consider hour-per-week as the other important features is because I think that assuming salary per hour fixed in this world, more time you spend working, of course, more money you will earn.**"

I think the reason that marital status is the most important is just like I mentioned in question 6, though I did not see this feature as my top one. In the graph, we can see that marital status is a real important feature since its weight is 0.4. marital status does have significant influence to income. The top 2 to top 5 are occupation and education level which I see as my first two features. Although, in this graph, these two features are much less important than marital status, these two features' weight are still about 20% which, I think, confirms my thought. From the graph, the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of all features present in the data, I think that confirms my guess in question 6 is close to the answer.**"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
